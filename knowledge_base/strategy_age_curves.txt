Dynasty Strategy: Understanding Age Curves
Age curves are a foundational concept in dynasty fantasy football, as player value is closely tied to career trajectory and longevity. Each position—quarterback (QB), running back (RB), wide receiver (WR), and tight end (TE)—has a unique age curve that influences how managers should value players.
**Quarterbacks (QB):**
QBs generally have the longest productive careers in fantasy football. Elite quarterbacks can maintain top-tier performance into their mid-to-late 30s, thanks to the position’s reliance on experience, decision-making, and less physical wear compared to skill positions. Value peaks for QBs often occur between ages 25-32, but top options can remain valuable well beyond that window.
**Running Backs (RB):**
RBs have the shortest and most volatile value curves. Most running backs peak between ages 22-26, with a sharp decline often beginning after age 27. The physical demands of the position—frequent contact, high injury risk, and team tendency to rotate backs—make RB value fragile. Even elite talents can see rapid value drops due to injury or changes in usage. Dynasty managers should be cautious about investing heavily in older RBs and should look to sell before the decline.
**Wide Receivers (WR):**
WRs typically break out in their second or third season and can sustain high-level production into their late 20s and early 30s. The value curve is less steep than RBs, with many top receivers remaining fantasy-relevant through age 30. However, athleticism and target volume are key, and a decline in either can signal a downturn.
**Tight Ends (TE):**
TEs often develop more slowly, with many not reaching their fantasy peak until age 25-28. Once established, elite TEs can remain productive into their early 30s, especially if they are key parts of their team’s passing attack. The scarcity of difference-makers at the position can extend the value window for top TEs.
**Summary:**
Understanding age curves helps dynasty managers anticipate value shifts and make informed decisions about when to buy, hold, or sell players. Running backs are the most fragile assets, while quarterbacks and tight ends can offer longer-term stability. Wide receivers provide a balance of longevity and upside, making them cornerstone assets for many dynasty rosters.
