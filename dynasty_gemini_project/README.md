# Dynasty Gemini Project

## Overview

The Dynasty Gemini Project is a toolkit for building and maintaining a custom Gemini AI expert in dynasty fantasy football. It combines dynamic player data, strategic knowledge articles, and custom instructions to create a world-class dynasty advisor—'Dynasty Oracle'—that delivers actionable, data-driven insights for your league.

## Python Virtual Environment (Recommended)

It is strongly recommended to use a Python virtual environment (venv) for this project to avoid dependency conflicts and keep your environment clean.

### How to Set Up and Use a venv

1. **Create a virtual environment** (from the project root or `scripts/` folder):
   ```powershell
   python -m venv venv
   ```
2. **Activate the virtual environment:**
   - On Windows (PowerShell):
     ```powershell
     .\venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
     ```
   - On Windows (cmd):
     ```cmd
     venv\Scripts\activate.bat
     ```
   - On macOS/Linux:
     ```sh
     source venv/bin/activate
     ```
3. **Install dependencies:**
   ```sh
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
4. **Run the project as usual.**

To deactivate the venv, simply run `deactivate` in your terminal.

See [DESIGN_OVERVIEW.md](DESIGN_OVERVIEW.md) for a summary of the project architecture and data flow.

## Gemini Update Workflow

1. **Update Data:**  
   Run the `data_fetcher.py` script periodically (e.g., weekly) to generate an updated `dynasty_market_data.csv` file in the `data_outputs` folder.
2. **Upload to Gemini:**  
   Go to your custom Gemini's configuration settings.
3. **Knowledge Base:**  
   Upload all files from the `knowledge_base` folder and the latest `dynasty_market_data.csv` file to the Gemini's knowledge base. (If old files exist, replace them.)
4. **Instructions:**  
   Copy the entire text from `custom_instructions.txt` into the Gemini's instruction field.
5. **Start Fresh:**  
   Save and start a new chat to use the updated Dynasty Oracle expert.
